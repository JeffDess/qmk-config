# Ximi v2

This is my [Ximi](https://fingerpunch.xyz/products/ximi-v2), a 36 keys with a bunch of features:

* Dual trackballs
* Rotary Encoders
* 3-way toggle switches
* Haptic Feedback
* Hotswap Gateron low-profile switches (KS33)

## Keymap

The keymap is optimized for software development and French/English typing.

* [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) layout
* French and Spanish characters support with dead key and accent layer
* Home row mods
* Mouse keys support
* Gaming Layer (shifted WASD position, free of homerow mods)
* Mnemonic key overrides

<p><small>
  NOTE: The keymap is programmed over the Canadian Multilingual Standard (CSA)
  base layout.

Also check out my other [ZMK keyboards](https://github.com/JeffDess/zmk-config)
based on the same keymap. I haven't set up a keymap drawer for this keymap yet,
but here's the keymap of my Urchin (I use 34 keys instead of 36 on the Ximi).
Only difference is the QWERTY and Ergo-L layers that I didn't include on this
keymap.

## Building the board

### Guide

I have followed [Ximi v1 build guide](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/fingerpunch/blob/master/keyboards/ximi/v1/BUILDGUIDE.md)
for assembly and soldering the Ximi.
