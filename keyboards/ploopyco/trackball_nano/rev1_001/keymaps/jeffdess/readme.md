## Ploopy Nano Keymap

Ploopy Nano keymap based on [LKBM](https://github.com/ploopyco/qmk-firmware-ploopyco-dev/blob/master/keyboards/ploopyco/trackball_nano/keymaps/lkbm/),
but with longer timeouts as it's a better fit for [my ZMK Keyboards](https://github.com/JeffDess/zmk-config/).

LKBM's orignal description:

> This keymap lets you send a 2-bit command by having a macro on your keyboard
tap `KC_NUM_LOCK` and `KC_CAPS_LOCK` on and off within a very short window
(25ms by default) to represent bits 1 and 2 respectively.
>
> The keymap uses this to allow toggling between sending mouse-movement events
and scrolling events; cycling DPI presets, and resetting to the bootloader,
so you can reflash without having to unscrew your Ploopy Nano.
